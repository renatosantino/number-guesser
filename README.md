# Number Guesser Ultimate Edition

It's a simple number guessing game developed in Python. 

The game picks a random number between 0 and 100 and the user has to guess which number it is. 

The script does a quick check if the user's guess is an actual number between 0 and 100, and then informs the player if the number guessed is lower or higher than the actual selected number. 

If the guess is correct, the user is asked if he wants to play again or not.

Possible improvements:
  - limited number of tries;
  - difficulty selection;
  - multiplayer.
